# Retention Radar: Customer Churn Data Prep

![Cancellation Rate]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cancellation_rate.png)

## Context  
An online streaming service has experienced a worrying uptick in customer cancellations over the past quarter. Leadership suspects hidden patterns in subscription behavior and listening habits are driving churnâ€”and they want a data-driven diagnosis before building any prediction models.

## Scope  
Identify customers at high risk of canceling their subscription based on their streaming activity and account status over the past three months.

## Objective  
1. Scope the churn-analysis project end to end  
2. Ingest customer and listening-history data into Python  
3. Clean and standardize all fields, resolve data issues, and derive new columns  
4. Explore and visualize key churn drivers both independently and after joining tables  
5. Deliver a final, non-null, numeric DataFrame with engineered features ready for modeling

## Process  
1. Project scoping & stakeholder alignment  
   - Reviewed goals with Customer Care to confirm data sources and churn definition  
   - Clarified deliverables: analysis-ready dataset + exploratory visuals  
2. Data ingestion  
   - Loaded customer profiles and streaming-history CSVs using Pandas  
   - Verified schema, identified missing or invalid entries, then dropped irreparable rows  
3. Data cleaning & feature derivation  
   - Harmonized date fields (subscription start, last play, cancellation) to datetime  
   - Imputed or removed missing values in key columns (plan_type, region)  
   - Engineered new features: tenure_days, avg_listens_per_day, last_month_play_count, genre_diversity_score  
4. Exploratory analysis  
   - Profiled each table: distributions of subscription lengths, play counts, churn rates  
   - Joined on customer_id to correlate listening patterns with cancellations  
   - Used box plots and density estimates to highlight churner vs. retainer differences  
5. Final DataFrame prep  
   - Isolated numeric predictors with no nulls  
   - Scaled features and flagged high-risk segments (e.g., low-engagement, free-trial users)  
   - Produced a feature-correlation heatmap against churn

## Output  
- A clean, feature-rich Pandas DataFrame (`churn_ready_df.csv`) primed for machine learning  
- A Jupyter notebook showcasing EDA visualizations: histograms, boxplots, heatmaps  
- A concise slide deck summarizing top churn drivers and recommended next steps for modeling

## Design Principles  
- Alignment & Proximity: Grouped related metrics (engagement vs. tenure) for intuitive comparison  
- Enclosure: Used distinct chart backgrounds to separate analyses before and after table join  
- Colour & Hue: Applied a diverging palette to highlight positive vs. negative churn correlations
